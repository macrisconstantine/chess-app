# chess-app 
- I made a simple JavaScript-powered chess web app developed in close collaboration with my good friends ChatGPT and Copilot.
- This was a casual mini-project I started in order to learn the programming behind chess rules and chess algorithms.
- NOTE: Stockfish will not work on the Github pages siteâ€”since Github only supports static sites. If you would like to try the Stockfish evaluation, you will have to clone or download the repo and install some dependencies.
- TODO: add more cool features that make this actually worth visiting
- Update: added the beginning of an indicator feature.

- For my favorite cousin who gives me apples and oranges and candy : )

# chess-app 
- I made a simple JavaScript-powered chess web app developed in close collaboration with my good friend ChatGPT and Copilot.
- This was a casual mini-project I started in order to learn the programming behind chess rules and chess algorithms.
- NOTE: Stockfish will not work on the Github pages site--since Github only supports static sites. If you would like to try the Stockfish evaluation, you will have to clone or download the repo and install some dependencies.
